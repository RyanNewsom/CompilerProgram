# Compilation Syntax Checker

This is a program I wrote for my Principles of Programming Languages class. It checks the syntax of a program, and gives out the appropriate error logs, if any are found. Please ignore the poor structure, I once got docked 30% on a program for using packages.. I use them outside of school!
